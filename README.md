# SONAR_MINE_Vs_ROCK_PREDICTION_BYUSING_NEURAL_NETWORK_WITH_DROPOUT_LAYER
The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock. In this we would learn how to add Dropout learn and how to handle overfitting in neural network
